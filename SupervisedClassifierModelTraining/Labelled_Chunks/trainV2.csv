"
2,"the direction of the result broadly would be in consonance with the message
"
1,"Jaitley said in a blogpost titled ‘The Message of Exit Polls
"
1,"The hard reality is that when multiple Exit Polls convey the same message

"
1,"Observing that EVMs play no role in exit polls
"
1,"the minister said if the actual results of the general election are in the same direction as exit polls
"
1,"If the Exit Polls are read along with the 2014 election results
"
2,"it would be clear that there is a huge maturing of Indian democracy taking place
"
2,"The electorate keeps national interest paramount before exercising a choice on whom to vote for

"
0,"The Martyrs Week programme has been announced by Awami Action Committee and Hurriyat leaders would “take a pledge to carry on the peaceful struggle for the right to self-determination”, does not make sense
"
2,"the ‘pledge’ would be interpreted as distancing from the component of armed struggle

"
2,"youths are realising that ""we do not want to become fodder for Pakistani agencies

2,"Successful infiltration from across the Line of Control (LoC) is virtually becoming very difficult

"
0,"The exit polls predicting the BJP 2.0 at the centre have been largely contrary to the expectations in the country
"
0,"Modi wasn't all along a favourite to win
"
0,"but the conspicuous absence of a wave in the PM's favour
"
2,"led the people anticipate an outside chance for the Congress and the wider opposition
"
2,"it was expected that the exit polls  reflect a more nuanced picture of the outcome
"
0,"While Modi's loss was not factored in, people didn't see him getting a majority on his own
"
0,"But contrary to this, the exit polls have again predicted  more or less a comfortable BJP majority
"
2,"The most probable outcome was seen the return of Modi in a weaker coalition
"
0,"eason for this is that the polls have shown the shortfall in UP
"
2,"where the party had previously done well
"
2,"compensated by an improved performance in West Bengal and the North East
"
0,"it will be a big setback for the opposition which apparently seemed to have led a valiant campaign against the BJP
"
0,"At the same time Modi still carrying the day will certainly raise questions about the nature of the opposition campaign
"
0,"there were certainly areas and aspects where the opposition confronted Modi with little to no resistance
"
0,"One such aspect was the reluctance to take on the BJP on ideological front
"
2,"nstead, the opposition, particularly Congress  aggressively plied a development agenda
"
2,"Congress president Rahul Gandhi's NYAY scheme promising Rs 72000 crore to the 20 per cent of the poorest families in India  tried to dent the BJP's ideological sting
"
0,"Congress tried to shift the battlefield to economy
"
2,"while Modi  determinedly stuck to nationalism, security and terror
"
0,"The PM  chose to play down his development mantra
"
0,"His unhelpful record on this front stood in the way
"
0,"So, he brought his party's ideology into play
"
0,"Kashmir, Pakistan, terrorism, security  became its staple issues
"
2,"The  BJP also took recourse to its longstanding ideological position on J&K which in recent years has found increasing resonance with a significant section of the population across the country
"
2,"however, the contest is about the two ideas of India
"
2,"The poll outcome will thus  determine the ideological and development course of the country over the next five years
"
2,"And here's  hoping it is a course that is equally salutary for the minorities of the country
"
0,"And should exit polls come true,  it should be an occasion for some deep reflection for the opposition
"
2,"More than a rethink on tactics next time round, they would need to work on an alternative vision of India and project it forcefully and with conviction to the people

"
